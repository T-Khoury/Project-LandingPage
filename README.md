# Project-LandingPage
Pre:
In this project I will build a basic/standard landing page from scratch using HTML and CSS.  The goal of this project is to practice and apply what I have learned so far in HTML and CSS.

Post:
I have done my best to make my landing page look like the reference picture while trying to add some nicer touches with the pictures.  I am pretty happy with how I have done and I was very focused when working on this project.  I did not struggle too much with any part, I had to look up a couple things but was able to find all the answer's I needed easily.  I am excited to continue improving my skills and design even better webpages in the future.
